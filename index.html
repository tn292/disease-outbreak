                    <p> In the pursuit of advancing public health, general safety, and medical preparedness, the study
                        of diseases has grown to become a critical area of focus for researchers and health
                        professionals worldwide. The complex nature of disease spread, influenced by an array of
                        factors, including but not limited to, socioeconomic status, environment, sex, and age, demands
                        a comprehensive approach to understand and hopefully mitigate its impacts. The Disease Outbreak
                        project aims to delve deep into the patterns of disease outbreaks, investigate the reasons for
                        these trends, and predict possible outcomes. </p>

                    <p> Asthma, a prevalent respiratory condition familiar to many, is the specific focus of our
                        research. This decision stems from the widespread impact of asthma and the variability in its
                        prevalence across different populations and geographies. The primary goal of this project is to
                        investigate how asthma affects diverse groups and regions over time. By analyzing prevalence
                        rates, we aim to uncover underlying trends and patterns, such as seasonal variations and
                        geographical disparities. These analyses will help us identify the populations most at-risk, as
                        well as regions that are disproportionately affected. Employing advanced predictive modeling
                        techniques, our project seeks to enhance our ability to predict asthma prevalence with some
                        precision. Through this rigorous research and analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights
                        into asthma prevalence in the United States. </p>

            <p> Asthma is a chronic disease impacting respiratory airways in the lungs: inflammation causes the airways
                to narrow, making breathing difficult, and subsequently induces coughing, wheezing, and shortness of
                breath. Approximately 7.7% of Americans have asthma according to national data from 2021 , equating to
                roughly 25 million people in the United States (CDC, 2023); additionally, approximately 300 million
                people worldwide are asthmatic as well. (Braman, 2006) While studies have not pinpointed a concrete cure
                for asthma, there are still ways to manage the systems to live a normal life.

            </p>

            <p> Scientists are still seeking the true cause of asthma, but many factors are linked with its
                distribution. Asthma presumably has a genetic factor, as an individual with an asthmatic parent is three
                to six times more likely to develop asthma than an individual without one. (American Lung Association,
                2023) Air pollution and exposure to smog may raise risk for inducing asthma as well, which has
                historically led people to believe that those who live in urban areas incur a higher risk of developing
                asthma.
            </p>

            <p> Additionally, specific groups of people are disproportionately affected by asthma. Low-income and senior
                adults have the highest asthma rates, deaths, and hospitalizations. People in the overweight and obese
                weight categories are at a greater risk for contracting asthma. Some additional risk factors include
                smoking (or having a mother who smoked during pregnancy), viral respiratory infections, and allergies.
                There is even a subset of the disease known as occupational asthma, which is specifically triggered by
                irritants in the workplace such as vapors, fumes, and dust. </p>

            <p> Along with factors that may lead to a larger incidence of asthma, scientists have also examined
                comorbidities of asthma. A comorbidity is the simultaneous presence of one specific disease with
                another, which can potentially alter the symptoms or signs of both diseases. One such example of a
                comorbidity with asthma is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which yields many similar
                symptoms to asthma, including wheezing, chronic coughing, and shortness of breath. This disease affects
                11.2 million people in America (American Lung Association, 2023). The two diseases have shown such
                overlap, and great difficulty differentiating between the two has become so prevalent, a new diagnosis
                known as Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) has emerged (American Lung Association, 2023). Individuals
                with ACOS have been shown to exhibit more severe and frequent symptoms than those with asthma or COPD
                alone. Another comorbidity worth analyzing is obesity, which affects 39.6% of American adults. Obesity
                is associated with low-grade inflammation (including of the airways), along with an increased amount of
                adipose tissue, which alters the amount of inflammation hormones cause in the body.</p>

            <p> The majority of our visualizations incorporated data from the CDC Data Explorer
                tool, which allows one to directly download U.S state-based data in a CSV format. CSVs were downloaded
                according to the measure being studied, which ranged from subjects such as the distribution of the
                asthmatic population of male adults, to presence of formaldehyde in the air geographically. After being
                collected, the CSVs were read into RStudio, and appropriate R packages were installed, foremostly
                ggplot2, tidyverse, and USMAP. Once all datasets were imported into an RMarkdown file, the variable
                values needed to be subsetted in order to remove trailing percentage signs, and subsequently converted
                from an alphanumeric string to a numerical factor. After this processing, the datasets were able to
                flexibly be plotted in various visualizations, utilizing the pre-installed packages.


            </p>

            <p> Other visualizations utilized CSV files from the CDC, WHO and NIH and then imported the data using
                Python's pandas library. We read the CSV files into DataFrames—a versatile data structure that allows
                for easy manipulation of the data. We then were able to address issues such as missing values, incorrect
                data types, and duplicate entries using DataFrame methods. </p>
            <p>
                Once the data was cleaned and processed, we visualized it using Folium, a Python library that aids in
                creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js library. To map our datasets with Folium, the DataFrame
                we acquired was iterated over to extract geographic coordinates and other information, which are then
                used to add markers to a Folium map.

                <p>Looking at the visual, the darkest regions correspond with areas of the highest asthmatic residence.
                    These can be identified as the Northeast, the Northwest, and Oregon. In contrast, fewer proportions
                    of asthmatic adults are found in the Midwest region and Texas.</p>

                <p>In explanation of these trends, the Northeast region of Lubbock County appears to have concrete batch
                    plants, which are potential sources of particulate matter (PM 2.5) emissions. PM 2.5 has been shown
                    to be a significant contributor to asthma hospitalizations (Zhou et al., 2021). The study cited
                    indicates that even a small increase in PM 2.5 levels is associated with a substantial rise in the
                    odds of having an asthma diagnosis.

                <p>
                    The high prevalence of asthma in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, notably in areas such as Seattle, can
                    be attributed to several factors, including the significant wildfire activity in the region.
                    Wildfires generate substantial amounts of smoke, leading to poor air quality and exacerbating
                    respiratory conditions like asthma. Additionally, industrial pollution and traffic congestion in
                    urban areas contribute to air pollution, further worsening respiratory health (American Fitness
                    Index, n.d.; Shaw, 2020). Socioeconomic disparities, such as poverty and limited access to
                    healthcare, are known to exacerbate asthma prevalence, particularly in vulnerable populations. These
                    factors, along with others, underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the
                    impacts of wildfires, improve air quality, and reduce socioeconomic inequities to mitigate asthma
                    prevalence in the Pacific Northwest.

                    Analyzing the asthma data from 2017 and 2021 reveals several key trends in the prevalence of asthma
                    across different states and territories in the U.S. Overall, the data indicates a mixed trend with
                    some states showing an increase in the number of individuals with asthma, while others exhibit a
                    decrease. Notably, California, the most populous state, experienced a significant increase in the
                    number of people with asthma, rising from approximately 2.4 million in 2017 to over 2.6 million in
                    2021. Other states such as Maine and New Hampshire also reported substantial increases in both the
                    absolute number of cases and the percentage of the population affected, suggesting a worsening
                    situation in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The increase in asthma prevalence in states like California, Maine, and New Hampshire could be
                    attributed to multiple factors including environmental, economic, and demographic changes. For
                    instance, worsening air quality, increased exposure to allergens, and changes in healthcare access
                    and diagnosis rates could contribute to higher asthma prevalence. Conversely, some states like
                    Florida showed a decrease in the percentage of the population with asthma, which could be due to
                    improvements in air quality, better healthcare interventions, and public health policies aimed at
                    reducing exposure to common asthma triggers. States that showed minimal or no increase, such as
                    Vermont and Puerto Rico, might benefit from stable environmental conditions or effective public
                    health strategies that mitigate the factors contributing to asthma.

                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class=" scrolling-content">
                <p> Based on the graph to the right, there was a large increase in the prevalence of asthma between 2001
                    and 2002, increasing by almost 4%. There was a relatively steady increase of cases from 2001 to
                    about 2015, after which there has been a steady decrease by about 1%. One potential reason for the
                    decrease in diagnosis after 2019 is due to the risk of transmission for COVID-19 causing diagnosis
                    services for lung diseases to slow due to risk of transmission (Singh, Sally J., et al). </p>

                <p> The increase in asthma prevalence following 2001 may be due to several factors. In the aftermath of
                    the 9/11 attacks, there was widespread exposure to dust and airborne pollutants, which could have
                    led to respiratory conditions like asthma in susceptible individuals (CDC, 2018). Moreover, the
                    heightened public awareness of respiratory health issues likely led to more people seeking medical
                    advice for respiratory symptoms, potentially increasing the rate of asthma diagnosis (American
                    Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).
                </p>

                <p> After 2015, the trend appears to reverse with a decrease in asthma diagnoses. This could be
                    indicative of a variety of factors, including improved air quality, successful public health
                    interventions targeting asthma risk factors, advancements in treatment and management, as well as
                    better patient education leading to reduced symptoms and exacerbations. During the COVID-19
                    pandemic, there was a notable decline in outpatient visits for non-COVID-related conditions,
                    including routine screenings for asthma, which could partially explain the dip in new asthma
                    diagnoses.

                    <p> Much of the existing literature suggests that rhinovirus, or the common cold, is strongly
                        related to a higher incidence of asthmatic people. Rhinovirus causes inflammation of bronchial
                        epithelial cells, which restricts airflow, exacerbating already restricted airways existing in
                        asthmatic individuals (Khan M. A., 2022). Since rhinovirus has its highest rate of incidence
                        during the winter and early spring months, this may be linked with worsened symptoms for
                        asthmatic individuals. Similarly, during early spring months, pollen counts in many regions of
                        the U.S. are at an all-year high, leading to worsened symptoms of seasonal allergies (such as
                        rhinitis). Since this can irritate the airways, it can further explain exacerbation of those
                        already dealing with asthmatic symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <p> Asthma prevalence refers to the proportion of the population affected by asthma at a given point
                        in time. According to the CDC, asthma prevalence is measured using data from the National Health
                        Interview Survey (NHIS), where respondents self-report whether they have ever been told by a
                        doctor, nurse, or other health professional that they have asthma, and whether they still have
                        asthma. The current asthma prevalence percentage represents the proportion of individuals who
                        answered "Yes" to both questions. This measure provides an estimate of the burden of asthma on
                        the population and helps public health authorities understand the scope of the problem and
                        allocate resources accordingly.

                <p>Asthma and Poverty in the USA</p>
            </div>
            <p> Poverty can certainly affect health, and according to a City of NYC (“Why Asthma Is a Social Justice
                Issue”) article, “Why Asthma Is a Social Justice Issue”, the effect of asthma in New York City
                demonstrates this. When they mapped the percentage of people in poverty and then compared it againstto
                athe map of emergency department visits for asthma in children aged 5 to 17, a stark similarity
                occurred. It is clear that in NYC, asthma is a poverty issue, sinceas clearly neighborhoods with higher
                poverty rates also were known to have had higher rates of childhood hospital visits. Some potential
                explanations for this phenomenon could be split into poor housing and lack of quality health care. Poor
                living conditions mean that an asthmatic person would be in contact with mold, pests, dust, and other
                potential things that could trigger and worsen asthmatic symptoms. And poor people will also have tobe
                to access the higher-quality healthcare that most can, possibly being unable to afford or get medicine
                to control asthma’s symptoms (e.g. an inhaler).
            </p>

            <p> Evidently, the conventional perception regarding asthma is that it flourishes in poorer, densely
                populated city areas. Though some researchers have christened an “inner-city asthma epidemic”, not much
                thought has gone towards verification whether asthma is more common in urban regions than suburbs or
                rural areas. A study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (Kaplan) compared
                asthma rates among children in census tracts, and found that kids in inner-city neighborhoods were no
                more likely to have asthma than kids who live elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p> This is corroborated by our investigation of the distribution of poverty and asthma within the USA. The
                visualizations below were meant to determine if the correlation between poverty and asthma exists
                nationally or just within certain cities.

            <p> When examining nation-wide data of the distribution of poverty and asthma, poverty demonstrates much higher percentages in the Southern regions, especially New Mexico and Louisiana. In contrast, and as mentioned above, asthma is most prevalent in the Northeast and Northwest regions.</p>
            <p> Potential Risk Factors That May Lead to Increased Asthma Prevalence in the Northwest and Northeast:
                The Climates in both regions tend to have cooler, damper air for much of the year, which can lead to the growth of mold in homes and common infrastructure accessed by at-risk individuals
                There is a prevalence of allergens, like increased pollination, that can exacerbate asthma symptoms

                <p> On the contrary, our visuals show the opposite story when it comes to adolescents and children. Male youths have approximately 1.5x higher rates of asthma than female youths. 
                </p>
                <p> This gender difference is caused in part by the effects of sex hormones on lung cells, as testosterone hinders an immune cell linked to asthma symptoms, such as inflammation and mucus production in the lungs. Testosterone also has a positive effect on the immune system – it diminishes the presence of a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILC), so the immune system becomes less reactive to factors that would normally trigger asthma symptoms (add source).  On the contrary, estrogen acts on the immune system to increase the severity of asthma symptoms, and acts indirectly to damage lung mechanics and increase inflammation (add source).
                </p>
                <p> After puberty, women are twice as likely to have asthma as men, and the pattern continues until women hit menopause, and then the asthma rates in women start to decline. In fact, after puberty, asthma becomes about 40 percent more prevalent in women, and women older than 15 are 2.3 times more likely than men to be admitted to the hospital for asthma (add source). 
                </p>

                <p> Though these are the most apparent and referenced reasons for differences between male and female rates of asthma before and after puberty, there are other factors that may play into these trends. For example, women generally have smaller airways compared to men, which may contribute to increased airway resistance and susceptibility to asthma symptoms. Smaller airways can also make it more difficult to clear mucus and other irritants, leading to greater airway inflammation and obstruction. Women also tend to have stronger immune responses and which can lead to heightened inflammation and airway reactivity in response to asthma triggers. In order to ascertain these factors as contributing to the trends seen between men and women with asthma, more empirical research is needed.

                                <p> Based on the analysis of current asthma prevalence in the United States by age
                                    group, we found that young adults (age groups 15-19 and 20-24) had the highest
                                    percentages of asthma, with 9.3% and 10.3% respectively. This increase in prevalence
                                    for those from birth up to age 24 might be due to changes in how asthma is diagnosed
                                    and accounted for, and/or better awareness of asthma and thus diagnoses systems for
                                    adults. Or, it could also be due to the fact that false attribution of other
                                    respiratory symptoms to doctor-diagnosed asthma might have occurred for adults.
                                </p>
                                <p> An increase of asthma prevalence for those who have reached adulthood might also be
                                    due to the factor of adult-onset asthma. Previous studies have shown that
                                    adult-onset asthma is more non-allergenic and more prevalent in women.</p>
                                <p> Similarly, another factor that might influence the higher prevalence of asthma in
                                    higher age groups is occupational asthma or environmental risk factors. For example,
                                    different factors like long-term exposure to O3 air pollution, organic dusts, and
                                    cleaning agents have all been shown to be associated with asthma onset for adults.
                                </p>
                                <p> This might explain why prevalence increased in higher age groups and remains
                                    relatively the same for the three latter age groups (25-34, 35-64, 65+). In addition
                                    to those who received diagnoses offor asthma in childhood, the higher age groups
                                    also include those with occupational or environment-affected asthma development.</p>

                                <p> The graph depicting asthma mortality rates by age in the USA clearly shows that the
                                    elderly population has a significantly higher mortality rate from asthma compared to
                                    younger people. This trend can be attributed to several age-related factors. As
                                    people age, their immune systems typically weaken, and lung function naturally
                                    declines. This can make the elderly more vulnerable to respiratory conditions,
                                    including the severity of asthma attacks which can be fatal.
                                </p>
                                <p> Furthermore, older adults may have a range of comorbidities, such as COPD or heart
                                    disease, which can complicate asthma management and exacerbate its symptoms. The
                                    ability to recover from asthma exacerbations also diminishes with age, increasing
                                    the risk of mortality. Moreover, polypharmacy, which refers to the use of multiple
                                    medications, is common in this age group and can lead to drug interactions that
                                    potentially worsen asthma control (Hanania & Sharafkhaneh, 2018).
                                </p>
                                <p> Additionally, there may be social and behavioral factors at play. Older adults are
                                    often less likely to recognize or report symptoms of asthma. They might downplay
                                    their symptoms or attribute them to general aging, leading to under-treatment.
                                    Healthcare access issues, cognitive decline, or physical limitations can also
                                    interfere with effective asthma management in older adults. All these aspects
                                    combined contribute to the higher rates of asthma-related deaths in the elderly as
                                    depicted in the graph. For further details, the CDC Asthma Hub and the referenced
                                    studies provide a wealth of information on asthma management and risks in older
                                    adults (Baptist & Busse, 2014; AAFA, n.d.).
