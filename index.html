                    <p> In the pursuit of advancing public health, general safety, and medical preparedness, the study
                        of diseases has grown to become a critical area of focus for researchers and health
                        professionals worldwide. The complex nature of disease spread, influenced by an array of factors
                        including but not limited to socioeconomic status, environment, sex, and age, demands a
                        comprehensive approach to understand and hopefully mitigate its impacts. The Disease Outbreak
                        project aims to delve into the patterns of disease outbreaks, investigate the reasons for these
                        trends, and predict possible outcomes using this data.
                    </p>

                    <p> Asthma, a prevalent respiratory condition familiar to many, is the specific focus of our
                        research. This decision stems from the widespread impact of asthma and the variability in its
                        prevalence across different populations and geographies. The primary goal of this project is to
                        investigate how asthma affects diverse groups and regions over time. By analyzing prevalence
                        rates, we aim to uncover underlying trends and patterns, such as seasonal variations and
                        geographical disparities. These analyses will help us identify the populations most at risk, as
                        well as regions that are disproportionately affected. Employing advanced predictive modeling
                        techniques, our project seeks to enhance our ability to predict asthma prevalence with some
                        precision. Through this rigorous research and analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights
                        into asthma prevalence in the United States.

                breath. Approximately 7.7% of Americans have asthma according to national data from 2021, equating to
                roughly 25 million people in the United States (CDC, 2023); additionally, approximately 300 million
                people worldwide are asthmatic as well. (Braman, 2006) While studies have not pinpointed a concrete cure
                for asthma, there are still ways to manage the systems to live a normal life.
            </p>

            <p> Scientists are still seeking the true cause of asthma, but many factors are linked to its distribution.
                Asthma presumably has a genetic factor, as an individual with an asthmatic parent is three to six times
                more likely to develop asthma than an individual without one. (American Lung Association, 2023) Air
                pollution and exposure to smog may raise the risk of inducing asthma as well, which has historically led
                people to believe that those who live in urban areas incur a higher risk of developing asthma.
            </p>

            <p> Additionally, specific groups of people are disproportionately affected by asthma. Low-income and senior
                adults have the highest asthma rates, deaths, and hospitalizations. People in the overweight and obese
                weight categories are at a greater risk of contracting asthma. Some additional risk factors include
                smoking (or having a mother who smoked during pregnancy), viral respiratory infections, and allergies.
                There is even a subset of the disease known as occupational asthma, which is specifically triggered by
                irritants in the workplace such as vapors, fumes, and dust.
            </p>

            <p> Along with factors that may lead to a larger incidence of asthma, scientists have also examined
                comorbidities of asthma. Comorbidity is the simultaneous presence of one specific disease with another,
                which can potentially alter the symptoms or signs of both diseases. One such example of comorbidity with
                asthma is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which yields many similar symptoms to asthma,
                including wheezing, chronic coughing, and shortness of breath. This disease affects 11.2 million people
                in America (American Lung Association, 2023). The two diseases have shown such overlap, and great
                difficulty differentiating between the two has become so prevalent, that a new diagnosis known as
                Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) has emerged (American Lung Association, 2023). Individuals with ACOS
                have been shown to exhibit more severe and frequent symptoms than those with asthma or COPD alone.
                Another comorbidity worth analyzing is obesity, which affects 39.6% of American adults. Obesity is
                associated with low-grade inflammation (including of the airways), along with an increased amount of
                adipose tissue, which alters the amount of inflammation hormones cause in the body.

        <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p> The majority of our visualizations incorporated data from the CDC Data Explorer tool, which allows one
                to directly download U.S state-based data in a CSV format. CSVs were downloaded according to the measure
                being studied, which ranged from subjects such as the distribution of the asthmatic population of male
                adults, to presence of formaldehyde in the air geographically. After being collected, the CSVs were read
                into RStudio, and appropriate R packages were installed, foremostly ggplot2, tidyverse, and USMAP. Once
                all datasets were imported into an RMarkdown file, the variable values needed to be subsetted in order
                to remove trailing percentage signs, and subsequently converted from an alphanumeric string to a
                numerical factor. After this processing, the datasets were able to flexibly be plotted in various
                visualizations, utilizing the pre-installed packages.
            </p>

            <p> Other visualizations utilized CSV files from the CDC, WHO and NIH and then imported the data using
                Python's pandas library. We read the CSV files into DataFrames—a versatile data structure that allows
                for easy manipulation of the data. We then were able to address issues such as missing values, incorrect
                data types, and duplicate entries using DataFrame methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the data was cleaned and processed, we visualized it using Folium, a Python library that aids in
                creating interactive maps using the Leaflet.js library. To map our datasets with Folium, the DataFrame
                we acquired was iterated over to extract geographic coordinates and other information, which are then
                used to add markers to a Folium map.
            </p>
            <p> Finally, the following data collection, cleaning, and tools were used when analyzing asthma prevalence
                in relation to socioeconomic indicators for New York State (NYS).
                Data was collected from the following sources:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> All asthma prevalence data at the NYS county-level was sourced from the New York State Asthma
                    Dashboard. This data was already partially compiled and focused on indicators of asthma prevalence
                    like emergency department visits, hospital discharge data, deaths/death rates, and Medicaid managed
                    care population statistics.
                </li>
                <li> Out of these indicators of asthma prevalence, one was initially chosen: general adults' current
                    asthma prevalence. The data for this indicator was itself based on the following survey question:
                    “Do you still have asthma?” with the possible responses being "Yes, No, Don’t know, Refused" from
                    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
                    The BRFSS data comes from annual statewide telephone and cellular surveys conducted by the CDC.
                </li>
                <li> The most recent data on socioeconomic indicators (such as personal income per capita, unemployment
                    rates, and high school dropout rates) by county in NYS was obtained from the Rockefeller Institute
                    of Government.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Afterwards, the data cleaning process mainly involved ensuring consistent data formats for analysis.
                Pandas was again utilized to read and clean the data, which came in CSV and Excel file formats.
                Techniques like renaming columns, stripping extraneous spaces, and filtering for specific years (e.g.,
                2017 and 2018) or for the most recent-year data (2021) was used to prepare the datasets for analysis.
            </p>
            <p> As for visualizations, Seaborn and Plotly Express were utilized; the former was used for static
                visualizations like the scatterplots whereas the latter was utilized to create the interactive
                choropleth maps (geographic visualizations which are similar to heat maps) that are delineated by
                county.

                <p> Looking at the visual, the darkest regions correspond with areas of the highest asthmatic residence.
                    These can be identified as the Northeast, the Northwest, and Oregon. In contrast, fewer proportions
                    of asthmatic adults are found in the Midwest region and Texas.
                </p>

                <p> In explanation of these trends, the Northeast region of Lubbock County appears to have concrete
                    batch plants, which are potential sources of particulate matter (PM 2.5) emissions. PM 2.5 has been
                    shown to be a significant contributor to asthma hospitalizations (Zhou et al., 2021). The study
                    cited indicates that even a small increase in PM 2.5 levels is associated with a substantial rise in
                    the odds of having an asthma diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The high prevalence of asthma in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, notably in areas such as Seattle, can
                    be attributed to several factors, including the significant wildfire activity in the region.
                    Wildfires generate substantial amounts of smoke, leading to poor air quality and exacerbating
                    respiratory conditions like asthma. Additionally, industrial pollution and traffic congestion in
                    urban areas contribute to air pollution, further worsening respiratory health (American Fitness
                    Index, n.d.; Shaw, 2020). Socioeconomic disparities, such as poverty and limited access to
                    healthcare, are known to exacerbate asthma prevalence, particularly in vulnerable populations. These
                    factors, along with others, underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the
                    impacts of wildfires, improve air quality, and reduce socioeconomic inequities to mitigate asthma
                    prevalence in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p>
                    Analyzing the asthma data from 2017 and 2021 reveals several key trends in the prevalence of asthma
                    across different states and territories in the U.S. Overall, the data indicates a mixed trend with
                    some states showing an increase in the number of individuals with asthma, while others exhibit a
                    decrease. Notably, California, the most populous state, experienced a significant increase in the
                    number of people with asthma, rising from approximately 2.4 million in 2017 to over 2.6 million in
                    2021. Other states such as Maine and New Hampshire also reported substantial increases in both the
                    absolute number of cases and the percentage of the population affected, suggesting a worsening
                    situation in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The increase in asthma prevalence in states like California, Maine, and New Hampshire could be
                    attributed to multiple factors including environmental, economic, and demographic changes. For
                    instance, worsening air quality, increased exposure to allergens, and changes in healthcare access
                    and diagnosis rates could contribute to higher asthma prevalence. Conversely, some states like
                    Florida showed a decrease in the percentage of the population with asthma, which could be due to
                    improvements in air quality, better healthcare interventions, and public health policies aimed at
                    reducing exposure to common asthma triggers. States that showed minimal or no increase, such as
                    Vermont and Puerto Rico, might benefit from stable environmental conditions or effective public
                    health strategies that mitigate the factors contributing to asthma.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="container">
            <div class=" scrolling-content">
                <p> Based on the above graph, there was a large increase in the prevalence of asthma between 2001 and
                    2002, increasing by almost 4%. There was a relatively steady increase of cases from 2001 to about
                    2015, after which there has been a steady decrease by about 1%. One potential reason for the
                    decrease in diagnosis after 2019 is due to the risk of transmission for COVID-19 causing diagnosis
                    services for lung diseases to slow due to risk of transmission (Singh, Sally J., et al).
                </p>

                <p> The increase in asthma prevalence following 2001 may be due to several factors. In the aftermath of
                    the 9/11 attacks, there was widespread exposure to dust and airborne pollutants, which could have
                    led to respiratory conditions like asthma in susceptible individuals (CDC, 2018). Moreover, the
                    heightened public awareness of respiratory health issues likely led to more people seeking medical
                    advice for respiratory symptoms, potentially increasing the rate of asthma diagnosis (American
                    Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).
                </p>

                <p> After 2015, the trend appears to reverse with a decrease in asthma diagnoses. This could be
                    indicative of a variety of factors, including improved air quality, successful public health
                    interventions targeting asthma risk factors, advancements in treatment and management, as well as
                    better patient education leading to reduced symptoms and exacerbations. During the COVID-19
                    pandemic, there was a notable decline in outpatient visits for non-COVID-related conditions,
                    including routine screenings for asthma, which could partially explain the dip in new asthma
                    diagnoses.

                    <p> This graph shows an extremely high peak in asthma, rising by around 45% from February to March.
                        It then drops off to rates under 5% from April to November, remaining relatively constant. It
                        then slowly rises from December to February, before another major peak in asthma prevalence.
                    </p>
                    <p> Much of the existing literature suggests that rhinovirus, or the common cold, is strongly
                        related to a higher incidence of asthmatic people. Rhinovirus causes inflammation of bronchial
                        epithelial cells, which restricts airflow, exacerbating already restricted airways existing in
                        asthmatic individuals (Khan M. A., 2022). Since rhinovirus has its highest rate of incidence
                        during the winter and early spring months, this may be linked with worsened symptoms for
                        asthmatic individuals. Similarly, during early spring months, pollen counts in many regions of
                        the U.S. are at an all-year high, leading to worsened symptoms of seasonal allergies (such as
                        rhinitis). Since this can irritate the airways, it can further explain exacerbation of those
                        already dealing with asthmatic symptoms.

                    </p>
                    <p> Asthma prevalence refers to the proportion of the population affected by asthma at a given point
                        in time. According to the CDC, asthma prevalence is measured using data from the National Health
                        Interview Survey (NHIS), where respondents self-report whether they have ever been told by a
                        doctor, nurse, or other health professional that they have asthma, and whether they still have
                        asthma. The current asthma prevalence percentage represents the proportion of individuals who
                        answered "Yes" to both questions. This measure provides an estimate of the burden of asthma on
                        the population and helps public health authorities understand the scope of the problem and
                        allocate resources accordingly.

                </b>
            </div>
            <p> Poverty can certainly affect health, and according to a City of NYC article, “Why Asthma Is a Social
                Justice Issue”, the effect of asthma in New York City demonstrates this. When they mapped the percentage
                of people in poverty and then compared it against a map of emergency department visits for asthma in
                children aged 5 to 17, a stark similarity occurred. It is clear that in NYC, asthma is a poverty issue,
                since neighborhoods with higher poverty rates also were known to have higher rates of childhood hospital
                visits. Some potential explanations for this phenomenon could be split into poor housing and lack of
                quality health care. Poor living conditions mean that an asthmatic person would be in contact with mold,
                pests, dust, and other potential things that could trigger and worsen asthmatic symptoms. Higher quality
                healthcare will also be less available to the poor, meaning they could be unable to afford or obtain
                medicine to control asthma's symptoms.

            </p>

            <p> Evidently, the conventional perception regarding asthma is that it flourishes in poorer, densely
                populated city areas. Though some researchers have christened an “inner-city asthma epidemic”, not much
                thought has gone towards verification whether asthma is more common in urban regions than suburbs or
                rural areas. A study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (Kaplan) compared
                asthma rates among children in census tracts, and found that kids in inner-city neighborhoods were no
                more likely to have asthma than kids who live elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p> This is corroborated by our investigation of the distribution of poverty and asthma within the USA. The
                visualizations below were meant to determine if the correlation between poverty and asthma exists
                nationally or just within certain cities.

            <p> When examining nation-wide data of the distribution of poverty and asthma, poverty demonstrates much higher percentages in the Southern regions, especially New Mexico and Louisiana. In contrast, and as mentioned above, asthma is most prevalent in the Northeast and Northwest regions. </p>
            <p> Potential Risk Factors That May Lead to Increased Asthma Prevalence in the Northwest and Northeast:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The Climates in both regions tend to have cooler, damper air for much of the year, which can lead to the growth of mold in homes and common infrastructure accessed by at-risk individuals
                </li>
                <li> There is a prevalence of allergens, like increased pollination, that can exacerbate asthma symptoms
                </li>
                <li> These regions have relatively densely packed populations, leading to risk factors like increased exposure to vehicle emissions, industrial activity, 
                </li>

                <p> The results on the national scale between poverty and asthma can also be corroborated by data from

                <p> An elementary scan between the visualizations generated by both two data sets seems to reveal no noticeable correlation between income and asthma by county.

                <p> The same can be said between unemployment rates and public high school dropout rates versus asthma prevalence.

                    style="width: 80%; height: auto;" class="center"">
                <p> To further illustrate this point, we generate a simple correlation matrix showing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the prevalence of asthma (“Crude Rate”) and possible predictors (personal income per capita, unemployment rate, HS dropout rate).
                </p>

                <p> Strikingly, the visualization showing the prevalence of asthmatic women is shaded much darker than the visualization showing the prevalence of asthmatic men. Indeed, women are much more likely to have asthma in their adult years than the male population.

                <p> On the contrary, our visuals show the opposite story when it comes to adolescents and children. Male youths have approximately 1.5x higher rates of asthma than female youths.  
                </p>
                <p> This gender difference is caused in part by the effects of sex hormones on lung cells, as testosterone hinders an immune cell linked to asthma symptoms, such as inflammation and mucus production in the lungs. Testosterone also has a positive effect on the immune system – it diminishes the presence of a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILC), so the immune system becomes less reactive to factors that would normally trigger asthma symptoms.  On the contrary, estrogen acts on the immune system to increase the severity of asthma symptoms, and acts indirectly to damage lung mechanics and increase inflammation.

                </p>
                <p> After puberty, women are twice as likely to have asthma as men, and the pattern continues until women hit menopause, and then the asthma rates in women start to decline. In fact, after puberty, asthma becomes about 40 percent more prevalent in women, and women older than 15 are 2.3 times more likely than men to be admitted to the hospital for asthma. 
                </p>

                <p> Though these are the most apparent and referenced reasons for differences between male and female rates of asthma before and after puberty, there are other factors that may play into these trends. For example, women generally have smaller airways compared to men, which may contribute to increased airway resistance and susceptibility to asthma symptoms. Smaller airways can also make it more difficult to clear mucus and other irritants, leading to greater airway inflammation and obstruction. Women also tend to have stronger immune responses and which can lead to heightened inflammation and airway reactivity in response to asthma triggers. In order to ascertain these factors as contributing to the trends seen between men and women with asthma, more empirical research is needed.

                            <p> Based on the analysis of current asthma prevalence in the United States by age group, we
                                found that young adults (age groups 15-19 and 20-24) had the highest prevalences of
                                asthma, with 9.3% and 10.3% respectively. This increase in prevalence for those from
                                birth up to age 24 might be due to changes in how asthma is diagnosed and accounted for
                                and better awareness of asthma and thus diagnoses systems for adults. Or, it could also
                                be due to the fact that false attribution of other respiratory symptoms to
                                doctor-diagnosed asthma might have occurred for adults.
                            </p>
                            <p> An increase of asthma prevalence for those who have reached adulthood might also be due
                                to the factor of adult-onset asthma. Previous studies have shown that adult-onset asthma
                                is more non-allergenic and more prevalent in women (Rao & Mishra, 2023). Similarly,
                                another factor that might influence the higher prevalence of asthma in higher age groups
                                is occupational asthma or environmental risk factors. For example, different factors
                                like long-term exposure to O3 air pollution, organic dusts, and cleaning agents have all
                                been shown to be associated with asthma onset for adults (Le Moual et al., 2013). These
                                factors may explain the relatively constant prevalence of asthma in the three oldest age
                                groups as opposed to the two youngest age groups. In addition to those who received
                                diagnoses of asthma in childhood, the higher age groups would also include those with
                                occupational or environment-affected asthma development.
                            </p>

                            <!-- <p> Similarly, another factor that might influence the higher prevalence of asthma in
                                higher age groups is occupational asthma or environmental risk factors. For example,
                                different factors like long-term exposure to O3 air pollution, organic dusts, and
                                cleaning agents have all been shown to be associated with asthma onset for adults.
                            </p>
                            <p> This might explain why prevalence increased in higher age groups and remains
                                relatively the same for the three latter age groups (25-34, 35-64, 65+). In addition
                                to those who received diagnoses offor asthma in childhood, the higher age groups
                                also include those with occupational or environment-affected asthma development.</p> -->

                            <p> The graph depicting asthma mortality rates by age in the USA clearly shows that the
                                elderly population has a significantly higher mortality rate from asthma compared to
                                younger people. This trend can be attributed to several age-related factors. As people
                                age, their immune systems typically weaken, and lung function naturally declines. This
                                can make the elderly more vulnerable to respiratory conditions, including the severity
                                of asthma attacks which can be fatal.
                            </p>
                            <p> Furthermore, older adults may have a range of comorbidities, such as COPD or heart
                                disease, which can complicate asthma management and exacerbate its symptoms. The ability
                                to recover from asthma exacerbations also diminishes with age, increasing the risk of
                                mortality. Moreover, polypharmacy, which refers to the use of multiple medications, is
                                common in this age group and can lead to drug interactions that potentially worsen
                                asthma control (Hanania & Sharafkhaneh, 2018).
                            </p>
                            <p> Additionally, there may be social and behavioral factors at play. Older adults are often
                                less likely to recognize or report symptoms of asthma. They might downplay their
                                symptoms or attribute them to general aging, leading to under-treatment. Healthcare
                                access issues, cognitive decline, or physical limitations can also interfere with
                                effective asthma management in older adults. All these aspects combined contribute to
                                the higher rates of asthma-related deaths in the elderly as depicted in the graph. For
                                further details, the CDC Asthma Hub and the referenced studies provide a wealth of
                                information on asthma management and risks in older adults (Baptist & Busse, 2014; AAFA,
                                n.d.).

                                <p> After examining the factors contributing to the higher mortality rates from asthma
                                    in the elderly population, it's important to shift our focus to another vulnerable
                                    group: infants. While the elderly face age-related declines in lung function and
                                    immune response, resulting in a higher mortality rate from asthma, they are less
                                    likely to experience frequent asthma attacks compared to younger age groups due to
                                    various factors such as decreased physical activity and exposure to environmental
                                    triggers. In contrast, infants, with their developing respiratory systems and
                                    susceptibility to respiratory viruses, are particularly prone to asthma attacks.
                                    Babies are more susceptible to asthma attacks due to several factors. Their smaller
                                    airways can easily become blocked or irritated by viral infections, tight airways,
                                    or mucus buildup, making breathing difficult. Additionally, infants may lack the
                                    ability to effectively communicate their symptoms, leading to delays in diagnosis
                                    and treatment. Respiratory viruses, common in children under 5, are a major trigger
                                    for asthma symptoms in infants, with at least half of asthmatic children showing
                                    signs before age 5 (Vogelberg, 2019). Moreover, infants with a family history of
                                    asthma or allergies, specific allergies, or exposure to maternal smoking during
                                    pregnancy are at higher risk of developing asthma early in life. Identifying asthma
                                    in infants can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms with other conditions like
                                    bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia. Diagnostic methods such as lung function tests
                                    are often impractical, and doctors may rely on observing the child's response to
                                    medications, blood tests, allergy testing, and X-rays for diagnosis. Treatment
                                    involves administering asthma medications tailored for infants, typically through
                                    nebulizers or inhalers with spacers and masks. Caregivers should develop an Asthma
                                    Action Plan with their child's doctor to manage symptoms effectively and seek
                                    emergency care when necessary.

                                <p> Hospitalizations for asthma are most prevalent for infants, toddlers, and young
                                    children in the United States. This prevalence in pediatric hospitalization for
                                    asthma can potentially be explained by several factors, including differences in
                                    immune systems for infants and higher severity for younger populations, diagnostic
                                    issues in early childhood, and repeat hospitalizations. First, the immune systems of
                                    infants and children are much weaker than adults, making them more susceptible to
                                    respiratory infections such as those from RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and
                                    rhinovirus. Research has shown that such viral infections are the most common cause
                                    of symptom exacerbation in children. Physiologically, infants and children have
                                    smaller airways which contribute to the increased severity of symptoms due to
                                    blocked airways (Luz Garcia-Garcia et al., 2016).
                                </p>
                                <p> Another reason for higher rates of asthma in the youngest cohorts is the difficulty
                                    of asthma diagnosis for these age groups. First, asthma might be hard to diagnose
                                    for children and infants, who either cannot or have more difficulty communicating
                                    their symptoms. Secondly, due to asthma symptoms being very similar to other disease
                                    symptoms that young children might suffer severely from (e.g. pneumonia), the higher
                                    number of hospitalizations might also account for misdiagnosed cases. The diagnosis
                                    of asthma relies on direct methods like lung function tests, which might be
                                    difficult or risky to perform for infants. Thus, hospitalizations attributed to
                                    asthma might be overcounted for infants since their diagnoses might depend on less
                                    reliable methods (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2021).
                                </p>
                                <p> Finally, repeat hospitalizations for infants and young children might also explain
                                    why case counts are highest for this age group despite mortality rates being highest
                                    for older adults. The data does not count unique patient cases or new
                                    hospitalizations, but rather total numbers of hospitalizations. Research has shown
                                    that readmissions for severe asthma are prevalent for the “highest-risk” children,
                                    with up to one in four youth being rehospitalized within just thirty days (Kenyon et
                                    al., 2019). Repeat hospitalizations might also be attributed to the fact that
                                    parents and caregivers of these age groups are more aware and likely to seek medical
                                    attention for their children at younger ages. This proactiveness might explain any
                                    repeat hospitalizations and/or assessments that contribute to higher counts of
                                    hospitalizations for pediatric asthma patients.

                                Obesity can worsen asthma symptoms due to increased inflammation and physical pressure

                                    <p> Looking at the relative concentrations of individuals with asthma, COPD, and
                                        obesity among all 50 states, there seems to be some level of correlation between
                                        the three, but mostly between COPD and obesity. For example, in the Southeast
                                        United States, there is a high concentration of both obese individuals and
                                        individuals diagnosed with COPD.

                                    </p>
                                    <p> Asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) are both chronic
                                        respiratory conditions with overlapping symptoms and risk factors, leading to a
                                        notable correlation between the two. This correlation is largely due to the
                                        inflammatory processes and the pathophysiological traits they share, which can
                                        manifest in individuals as Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO). ACO is characterized by
                                        features typical of both diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness and
                                        obstruction, and tends to have a greater disease burden compared to each
                                        condition alone. Individuals with ACO often experience an earlier onset of
                                        symptoms and a steeper decline in lung function over time, necessitating a
                                        broader and more intense range of treatments (ERJ ERS Journals, 2022; BioMed
                                        Central, 2023).

                                    </p>
                                    <p> On the other hand, the correlation between asthma and obesity is significant due
                                        to the mechanical and inflammatory impacts of excess body weight on lung
                                        function. Obesity can exacerbate asthma by reducing lung volume, altering airway
                                        responsiveness, and increasing inflammation, thereby intensifying asthma
                                        symptoms and control issues. The link between COPD and obesity is less direct
                                        and not as strong; while obesity can worsen breathlessness in COPD patients, it
                                        doesn’t have as direct a role in the development or exacerbation of COPD as it
                                        does with asthma (ERJ ERS Journals, 2022; BioMed Central, 2023).

                                    </p>
                                    <p> Thus, the interconnections between asthma and COPD are more intrinsic due to the
                                        shared aspects of airway disease, while the relationship between asthma and
                                        obesity involves additional mechanisms related to body weight's impact on
                                        respiratory physiology. This explains why asthma is more closely linked with
                                        both COPD and obesity independently, rather than a direct correlation between
                                        COPD and obesity itself.

                                        alt="Correlation Matrix" class="center">
                                    <p> Our computed correlation matrix displays measures of geographic association
                                        between the afflictions of COPD, obesity, and asthma. Greater absolute values
                                        represent a stronger association, and values closer to 0 represent a lack of
                                        association. Interestingly, as mentioned previously, COPD and obesity show the
                                        strongest correlation coefficient, a measure that aims to gauge the strength of
                                        a linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. This may be
                                        due to the negative effects of obesity on respiratory disease, as buildup of fat
                                        around the heart, lungs, and chest, commonly associated with obesity, inhibit
                                        the functioning of those organs, which can exacerbate respiratory conditions.
                                        Additionally, about 65% of the COPD-having population falls in the overweight or
                                        obese categories (Verberne et al. 63), so geographic associations may be more
                                        pronounced between the two afflictions; in comparison, the asthmatic obesity
                                        rate was about 38.8% in the US in 2010. Though this figure is statistically
                                        larger than the nonasthmatic obesity rate (26.8%), it still is far less than the
                                        percentage of overweight or obese COPD-having individuals (CDC).

                                    <p> While asthma can also be influenced by environmental geographic factors, such as
                                        air pollution and external allergens, its geographical distribution may be less
                                        pronounced compared to COPD and obesity. This may be due to differences in the
                                        underlying mechanisms and triggers of asthma, such as genetic factors,
                                        allergies, and respiratory infections. Additionally, asthma may not always be
                                        solely influenced by external factors and can have a significant genetic
                                        component, which results in its geographical association being far less
                                        straightforward.

                                    <p> Asthma is influenced by a variety of both indoor and outdoor factors. These
                                        include environmental factors such as smoking and cigarette usage, wildfires,
                                        allergens, and pollutants, all of which have long been associated with the
                                        disease. It is thus of interest to study the geographic distribution of
                                        environmental factors in comparison to that of the adult asthmatic population in
                                        the United States. Such analysis may reveal better understanding of asthma
                                        triggers and development in addition to potential public health strategies on a
                                        state-by-state level.

                                    </p>
                                    <p> For example, it is worthwhile to study asthmagens, or known chemicals such as
                                        volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that cause asthma. Formaldehyde and
                                        acetaldehyde are two such VOCs that have been related to occupational asthma, so
                                        studying the environmental exposure to these chemicals would be key (Currie &
                                        Ayres, 2005). In addition, studying rates of asthma in relation to levels of
                                        smoking and cigarette usage is also essential because smoke, including
                                        secondhand tobacco smoke, has long been known as a trigger for asthma (Booalayan
                                        et al., 2020). Similarly, examining the relation of regions with frequent
                                        wildfires (and thus associated smoke) and rates of asthma might be helpful to
                                        understand such high-risk asthma areas and think of management efforts for
                                        air-quality related asthma prevalence.

                                    </p>
                                    <p> Specifically, we chose the chemicals formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to examine
                                        the geographic distribution of. When organic materials such as vegetation and
                                        biomass are burned, various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released into
                                        the atmosphere, including formaldehyde. Formaldehyde was hence chosen to study,
                                        due to its status as one of the most abundant non-methane volatile organic
                                        compounds; as a byproduct of incomplete combustion of organic matter, wildfires
                                        can produce significant amounts of formaldehyde along with other pollutants.
                                        Additionally, formaldehyde can be present in various indoor products commonly
                                        found in homes and workplaces, including building materials such as plywood,
                                        particleboard, and insulation, as well as household items like composite wood
                                        furniture, cabinets, and flooring; formaldehyde is commonly used in the
                                        production of these materials as a resin or adhesive to provide strength,
                                        durability, and moisture resistance. Additionally, formaldehyde may be present
                                        in permanent press fabrics, personal care products, and certain cleaning agents,
                                        and combustion sources like tobacco smoke and gas appliances can also release
                                        formaldehyde indoors. Long-term exposure to elevated levels of formaldehyde has
                                        adverse health effects, including respiratory irritation, allergy triggering,
                                        and potential carcinogenic effects (Liao et al. 18319-18331).

                                <p> There is not a huge similarity between the distribution of formaldehyde and asthma in the United States. In fact, California and some select states in the south have the highest percentage of formaldehyde in the atmosphere, but most of the states with the highest percentage of asthmatic adults are in the Northern United States, including Oregon and most of New England. A possible explanation for why formaldehyde could be darkened in California is because of the frequency of wildfires that occur at a much greater rate than most of the country. Meanwhile, a possible explanation for the increased rates of formaldehyde in the South could be due to more smokers being present in those areas. Formaldehyde emissions tend to increase in places with high humidity, and ozone also helps it exacerbate problems (Van Evra, 2019).  A possible reason that the formaldehyde and asthma distributions across the country are not very similar could be that pollutants as a whole could cause asthma, but not specifically one chemical. Formaldehyde is also really harmful at high concentrations, which people may not be exposed to very often.

                                            <p> Another airborne substance that would trigger asthma is cigarette smoke.
                                                Smoking is most prevalent in the states of West Virginia, Kentucky,
                                                Louisiana, and New Jersey, while asthma is most prevalent in the
                                                Northern states, indicating a discrepancy in trends. However, West
                                                Virginia and Kentucky both have higher asthma levels than any state
                                                surrounding them, possibly indicating a correlation between smoking and
                                                asthma. While it is certain that tobacco smoke is a powerful asthma
                                                trigger, it may not be as large of a cause as anticipated. Instead,
                                                smoking exacerbates the negative symptoms of asthma, leading to more
                                                frequent and severe attacks, and causing medication to work less
                                                effectively (Cleveland Clinic, 2021). Not only does smoking affect
                                                asthma, but exposure to secondhand smoke is also detrimental and is
                                                connected with more severe symptoms. But, asthma can be caused by a
                                                variety of factors, which may interact and work with each other, and
                                                asthma being more prevalent in the North could be due to those other
                                                factors.

                                            <p> Additionally, acetaldehyde is another VOC commonly found in tobacco
                                                burning, as well as various industrial emissions. Acetaldehyde was
                                                chosen to study due to its status as one of the leading harmful
                                                chemicals produced during the combustion of tobacco in cigarettes,
                                                cigars, and other tobacco products, associated with various health
                                                risks, including cancer and respiratory diseases. Additionally,
                                                acetaldehyde is emitted from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and
                                                combustion processes. Acetaldehyde can be emitted as a byproduct of
                                                industrial processes, particularly those involving combustion or
                                                chemical synthesis. Industries such as chemical manufacturing, petroleum
                                                refining, and metalworking may also acetaldehyde into the atmosphere as
                                                part of their emissions, contributing to air pollution and posing health
                                                risks to nearby communities.

                                                        fairness and accuracy of the model.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Ridge Regression was chosen for model building due to its
                                                        effectiveness in managing multicollinearity, which is a common
                                                        issue with one-hot encoded data and overlapping demographic
                                                        variables. The model was trained on 80% of the dataset, and the
                                                        remaining 20% was kept for validation. We used performance
                                                        metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the
                                                        coefficient of determination (R^2) to indicate high reliability
                                                        and predictive capability. Our model demonstrated high accuracy,
                                                        with a RMSE of 1.33 and a R^2 of 0.60, indicating that the model
                                                        could explain 80% of the variance in asthma prevalence among the
                                                        dataset.

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> We also adjusted the model to account for family history of
                                                        asthma. If a family history of asthma is indicated, the
                                                        prediction is adjusted upwards by a set percentage, in this case
                                                        by 10%.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> We then integrated the model into an interactive tool that
                                                        enables users to input their personal data and receive an
                                                        immediate asthma prevalence prediction. This tool is
                                                        particularly useful for individuals seeking insights into their

                <p>Conclusions and Next Steps</p>
            </b>
        </div>
        <p> Overall, asthma is associated with many factors, and the trends were explored in relation to gender, age,
            and possible exacerbating factors, including cigarette smoke, comorbidities, obesity, asthma triggers, and
            poverty. We were intrigued to find strong associations between some variables and weaker-than-expected ones
            for others, and then dove further into the potential reasoning behind these trends, in order to deepen our
            understanding of why asthma occurs and how it does to create a comprehensive asthmatic prevalence likelihood
            model.

        </p>
        <p> Given additional time and resources to broaden our field of study, there are many possible avenues of
            research and visualization that would be quite worthwhile to investigate. One interesting branch to develop
            would revolve around investigation of specific genetic factors linked with asthma in young children.
            Additionally, ascertaining whether certain factors affect those pregnant with asthmatic children would be
            interesting, as would studying associations of asthma with other comorbidities, such as GERD or rhinitis.
            Furthermore, though there is no outright cure for asthma, we also could investigate whether certain methods
            of prevention or deterrence have a statistically significant effectiveness rate compared to others.
        </p>
        <p> Another area of study would be investigating the impact of specific environmental pollutants on asthma
            incidence. While we did look into and saw very little correlation between AQI (the Air Quality Index) and
            asthma, it may be worthwhile to investigate how specific levels of particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen
            dioxide interact with asthma prevalence rates. Moreover, it would be interesting to explore the effects of
            lifestyle choices on asthma management, such as diet, exercise and stress levels.
